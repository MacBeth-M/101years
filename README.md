# 101 Years of Plane Crashes

## Overview
This project aims to analyze global aviation accidents to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Using a comprehensive dataset, we will explore various aspects of aviation accidents, including causes, frequency, and the impact of different factors such as aircraft type and geographical location.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Civil and commercial aviation accidents worldwide resulting in fatalities.
- Cargo, positioning, ferry, and test flight fatal accidents.
- Military transport accidents with 10 or more fatalities.
- Commercial and military helicopter accidents with greater than 10 fatalities.
- Civil and military airship accidents involving fatalities.
- Notable accidents involving famous people or of significant interest.

## Research Questions
1. What are the common causes of aviation accidents globally?
2. Is there a trend in the frequency of aviation accidents over time?
3. How do various factors like aircraft type and geographical location influence accident rates?
4. Have planes become safer over time?

## Methodology
The analysis will be conducted using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization. We will employ statistical methods to identify trends and correlations, and geospatial analysis to map accident locations.

## Collaboration - Using Feature Branch Workflow
We are employing the Feature Branch Workflow for this project to ensure a streamlined and conflict-free development process. Each team member will work on separate branches for different aspects of the analysis, which will then be merged into the main branch upon completion and review.
